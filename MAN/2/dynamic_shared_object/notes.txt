dlopen():
       The function dlopen() loads the dynamic shared object (shared
       library) file named by the null-terminated string filename and
       returns an opaque "handle" for the loaded object.  This handle is
       employed with other functions in the dlopen API, such as
       dlsym(3), dladdr(3), dlinfo(3), and dlclose().
