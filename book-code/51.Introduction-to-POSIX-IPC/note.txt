* The POSIX IPC interface is more consistent with the traditional
UNIX file model. IPC objects are identified by names, and managed
using open, close, and unlink calls that operate in a manner 
similarto the analogous file-related system calls.

* POSIX IPC provides an interface that is superior in many respects
to the System V IPC interface. However, POSIX IPC is somewhat less 
portable than System V IPC. Means System V IPC is supported by almost
all the UNIX but POSIX is not.
